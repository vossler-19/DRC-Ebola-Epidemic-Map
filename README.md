This animation provides a visualization of the spatial-temporal patterns of the Ebola 2018-2020 epidmic in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.  The data used for this animation includes 62 weeks of epidemic data, spanning the majority of the epidemic.  It is believed that smaller outbreaks begin in highly populated areas, such as Beni, Mabalako, Butembo, and Katwa, before spreading to outside towns and villages, resulting a heterogenous epidemic.
